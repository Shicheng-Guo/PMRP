Hi Shicheng,
Just to confirm, you want a file that maps the PMRP subject IDs in the files I sent on Feb. 12 with the identifiers in the attached file, correct?

Thanks,
Joe

Dear All, 

Please check the ID what I have. The first column of the enclose file is the ID for 18,624 genotyping data. We need to match/map the phenotype ID with genotype ID. 

Thanks.

Hi Rob,

Could you please give us the corresponding genotype data for this GWAS study at your earliest?

Thank you.

Hi Sanjay and Krishna,

Attached are the files:

r93633_cohort_send_SubjID.csv has the data with PMRP subject ID as the identifier r93633_cohort_send_contents.doc is the data dictionary from Jim Linneman

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dr. Shukla and Krishna,
Which PMRP ID do you want for these data?  I have:

eMERGEID - 8 digit numbers that begin with 16, e.g. "16123456"
PMRP Subject IDs - integers that range from 101 - 20595 Something else??

The ID you want would depend on the IDs in your genotypic data.  Do you have an example of such an ID so I can be sure I send the correct match?

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe... Can you add the ID that links to the PMRP genotypic data, drop the MHNs, and send the revised csv file on to Sanjay Shukla and Krishna Ganta. Also include the attached Word document that describes the variable fields in the file.

Thanks!
Jim

Dear Jim, 
                  Here are the responses for your questions. Please let me know if you have additional questions or if you need more information. 

1.            Subjects with confirmed cases of staph infection with various ICD 9 codes within 48 hours of a hospital visit. (this will be considered as community-onset Staph aureus infection. This will include all Staph related ICD-codes including bacteremia.

Would this be subjects who had a confirmed Staph infection within 7 days prior to the hospital admit date and 30 days after the discharge date, and also have any of the ICD 9 or ICD 10 infection codes (from the spreadsheet) within 2 days after the same hospitalization admit date?

KG: No. This would be a confirmed Staph infection within 7 days prior to the hospital admit date but within 48 hours of admit. 


2.            Subjects with recodes of multiple, independent infections based on the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. 

Would this be subjects who have multiple distinct confirmed Staph dates that have any of the ICD 9 or ICD 10 infection codes (from the spreadsheet) within 2 days after the same confirmed Staph date, regardless as to whether or not there was a hospitalization surrounding the confirmed Staph?

KG: Yes for subjects who have multiple distinct confirmed Staph dates that have any of the ICD 9 or ICD 10 infection codes (from the spreadsheet). Here hospital admission is not relevant. 


3.            Subjects who had required more than 3 days of antibiotic therapy after a confirmed staph infection based on the ICD-9 or -10 codes.

Would this be subjects who have a confirmed Staph infection and have any of the ICD 9 or ICD 10 infection codes (from the spreadsheet) within 2 days after the same confirmed Staph date (regardless as to whether or not there was a hospitalization surrounding the confirmed Staph), 

KG: Yes

and also have at least 3 days of antibiotic meds, with the meds starting within 2 days after the first infection ICD code date following the confirmed Staph infection date?

KG: Yes

Are these the antibiotics that would be used in treatment? 
cefazolin, cefuroxime (Zinacef, Ceftin), cephalexin (Daxbia, Keflex), nafcillin (Nafcil, Nallpen), oxacillin (Bactocill), dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, vancomycin (Vancocin), clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindagel, Cleocin T, Cleocin HCl, Evoclin, Clindacin), rifampin (Rifadin), and telavancin (Vibativ).
Please add or remove antibiotic meds to this list as needed.

KG: yes 

Thanks
Krishna

Can we have additional data based on the following criteria?

1.	Subjects with confirmed cases of staph infection with various ICD 9 codes within 48 hours of a hospital visit. (this will be considered as community-onset Staph aureus infection. This will include all Staph related ICD-codes including bacteremia

2.	Subjects with recodes of multiple, independent infections based on the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. 


3.	Subjects who had required more than 3 days of antibiotic therapy after a confirmed staph infection based on the ICD-9 or -10 codes.


Please let me know if I am clear in my thoughts or you may have any additional questions to be added.

Thank you

Sanjay... This is what I have completed so far on your Staph/MRSA request:

I have selected subjects from PMRP (not withdrawn from study) that have one or more of the diagnoses listed in the attached (ICD code 9 and 10 for staph updated.xlsx) list and also have a positive Staph/MRSA lab and/or positive MRSA by PCR. This results in a population of 2472 subjects.

Also attached is a list (r93633_cohort_send.xlsx) of the comorbid/age/demographic indicator fields compiled on the 2472 subjects and their corresponding definitions. Please review the list and let me know if it makes sense prior to me sending the data.

I also need to know whether this data will be sent offsite? If so, I can set any ages greater than age 90 to age 90 in order to be compliant with HIPPA rules.

Thanks!
Jim

Hi Jim,

Here are the responses. Thanks for raising very questions. I appreciated it.

Sanjay

    
    1. Diagnosis groups - Do you want the list of ICD codes collapsed into diagnosis groups such as Septicemia/Sepsis, Bacterial infection, Pneumonia, etc... and then add these comorbid indicators to the data that I return to you? If so, please review the attached spreadsheet to check if I have the diagnoses grouped properly. Please make any changes to any of the diagnosis groups and return the updated spreadsheet to me.

These disease codes should be restricted to infections caused by staphylococcus aureus including MRSA or MSSA 
    
    2. BMI - Is an individual's median BMI okay here? 

BMI data closest to the date of diagnosis
    
    3. Hospitalizations - Need a definition here? Is there a certain time point that you wish to look at as far as hospitalizations surrounding the confirmed Staph infection (+/- # of days/months etc...)?

From 7 days prior to the 30 days after
    
    4. Dialysis - Are you interested in dialysis prior to/on date of confirmed staph infection?

Prior


    5. Cancer - Any cancer at any time prior to staph infection? 

Yes
    
    6. Surgery - Are you interested in whether subject had any surgery within a certain time point around the date of confirmed staph infection?  If so, how many days (+/-)?

1 week before to 30 days after

        Jim will be working on this request for you.  Is this truly feasibility as you noted or is there a study and fiscal # we should be tracking to? Additionally, should Jim reach out to you directly with questions or is there someone on your team you'd like to delegate this to? Thank you!
